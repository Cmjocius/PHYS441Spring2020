# for N=10
# we need to construct a 10x10 matrix

### Comments ###
# You will need to define 位: what makes sense for this?
# Play with NumPy's diagflat function:
#       notice how it can be used to define the off-diagonal terms
#       what would be the result of just first + second + third?
#       how can you use this to adjust N so you don't have to manually type out the matrix
#       try using diagflat to create a 3 3x3 matrices of the correct kind and adding them together
# How do the boundary conditions of the well enter this problem?
#       consider how the number of points relates to positions in the well and the width of the well
